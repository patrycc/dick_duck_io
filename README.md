# Dick Duck Io

##Introduction
This game is the result of a challenge I had with a friend. "Let us learn python and then code 'Tic Tac Toe', so we can compare our results in the end!" After finishing learning python on codecadamy, I had a look at pygame and decided to use it for this little project, because it seemed pretty straightforward. 
It is a fairly simple implementation of 'Tic Tac Toe'. I'm not using OOP, because I think the skript is too simple to make proper use of OOP. But I could be wrong.

##Game Elements
Instead of using the well known cross and circle, I decided to use well known internet memes and a lesser known moon of Jupiter and to name the game after them.
